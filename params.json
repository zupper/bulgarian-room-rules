{"name":"Bulgarian StackOverflow Chatroom Rules","tagline":"","body":"This is the official set of rules for the Bulgarian Developers StackOverflow chatroom. Read them and abide by them, or risk the wrath of the room owners!\r\n\r\n### What are the rules?\r\n\r\nBasically stripped the Android room rules, but here it goes:\r\n\r\n* Speak either English, or Bulgarian.\r\n* Do not paste code into chat, instead use a site such as Ubuntu Pastebin or a GitHub Gist.\r\n* When you Ping (preface a username with an \"@\"), do it reasonably.\r\n* If you have an issue which you cannot solve after research, write your question on Stack Overflow and paste a link to it in the channel, it will be automatically formatted to allow people to read it.\r\n* If no one helps, we're either busy or we don't know.\r\n\r\n### How to get write access?\r\n\r\nThe room is generally read-only and write access has to be granted before one can write in the room. To get access, you need to cover all of the following:\r\n\r\n* Reputation > 100\r\n* Custom user name (and **NOT** user12345).\r\n* You have asked and answered reasonable questions on Stack Overflow.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
